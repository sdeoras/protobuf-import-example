Managing errors:

Imported proto file may have other dependencies, all of which need to be available during build.
For instance a missing dependency may cause following error:

k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apis/apiextensions/v1beta1/generated.proto: File not found.
k8s.io/api/core/v1/generated.proto: Import "k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apis/apiextensions/v1beta1/generated.proto" was not found or had errors.
k8sMesg.proto: Import "k8s.io/api/core/v1/generated.proto" was not found or had errors.
k8sMesg.proto:18:5: "k8s.io.api.core.v1.Pod" is not defined.

which is fixed by making sure ${GOPATH}/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver folder is present
